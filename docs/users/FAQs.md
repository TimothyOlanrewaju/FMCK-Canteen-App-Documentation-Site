This section answers questions commonly asked by users about the application. Be sure to read through carefully - you might find an answer to a question you have.

### ❓ I can't place a meal request

💡Make sure to contact your _**Admin Officer**_ to add your call dates to the Call Roster.

### ❓What happens when I get posted to another department

💡You have to change your department on the application to match the location of your _**Admin Officer**_ by following the steps listed [here](./Getting%20Started.md#change-department). Also, inform your Admin Officer to upload your call dates on the Call Roster - as your call dates might be different from your previous department.

### ❓ Can I change my meal request?

💡**No**. After placing a successful meal request, you won’t be able to place another one, as the application counts your previous request as one request which means you've exhausted your single permitted request for weekdays. On weekends and public holidays, the previous request counts as 1 out of the 2 permitted requests.
