This application offers:

- User-friendly interface.
- Effortless meal ordering.
- Real-time notifications.
- Order history.

This section is designed to help both front-end and back-end developers understand the architecture and development process of the system.

## Technology Stack

## System Architecture

The FMCK Canteen app was built using a Web and Application-Specific architecture, focusing on design patterns and organizational structures during development.

The application development process adhered to the strict structure of the Web and Application-Specific architecture for managing data flow, user interactions, backend processes, and the relationship between the client and server. This architecture further ensures that the application optimizes scalability, performance, and maintainability.

## Components Interaction

The application is a Multi-Page Application (MPA), and the components on the frontend and backend interact through traditional client-server architecture. This model typically involves server-side rendering (SSR), where each user interaction that requires a new page or updated content leads to a complete page reload.

On the Frontend (Client-Side):

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are rendered in the browser.
- Each user action that requires new content triggers a new HTTP request to the server.
- Pages are fully loaded or refreshed on every request.

On the Backend (Server-Side):

- Handles requests from the client and generates HTML responses dynamically.
- Serves static files such as CSS, JS, and images.
- Executes logic, interacts with the SQLite database, and delivers data/content.

## Project Directory Structure

The folder structure of the application is organized as follows:

```
└── 📁accounts
└── 📁canteen
└── 📁main
└── 📁static
└── 📁templates
```

### Accounts

This is the main directory for the `accounts` module, which handles user-related functionality such as user accounts, authentication and authorization.
It includes the following sub-folders and files:

```
└── 📁accounts
    └── 📁__pycache__
    └── 📁migrations
    └── __init__.py
    └── admin.py
    └── apps.py
    └── models.py
    └── tests.py
    └── urls.py
    └── views.py
```

- 📁**pycache**: This directory contains automatically generated bytecode files.
- 📁migrations: Contains database migration files that track changes to the database schema.
- **init**.py: Initializes the `accounts` module.
- `admin.py`: Contains the configuration for the Django admin interface for the `accounts` module.
- `apps.py`: Defines the `accounts` application configuration.
- `models.py`: Contains the data models for the `accounts` module, such as user models and related entities.
- `tests.py`: Contains test cases for the `accounts` module to ensure functionality.
- `urls.py`: Maps URL patterns to views for the `accounts` module.
- `views.py`: Contains the view functions or classes for rendering user interfaces or handling requests.

### Canteen

This is the main directory of the Django project, containing the primary settings and configuration files.
It includes the following sub-folder(s) and files:

    └── wsgi.py
```

- `__init__.py`: Marks this directory as a Python package, ensuring that Django can recognize it as part of the project.
- `asgi.py`: Contains the ASGI configuration for the project, which is used for handling asynchronous requests in Django.
- `settings.py`: Contains the main configuration for the project, including database settings, installed apps, middleware, static files settings, etc.
- `urls.py`: Defines the URL routing for the project, mapping URLs to views.
- `wsgi.py`: Contains the WSGI configuration for the project, used for deploying the project in a production environment.

### Main
